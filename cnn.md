# Convolutional Neural Network

* In the context of a convolutional neural network, a convolution is a linear operation that involves the multiplication of a set of weights with the input, much like a traditional neural network. The multiplication is performed between an array of input data (e.g., an image) and a two-dimensional array of weights, called a filter or a kernel.

* The type of multiplication applied between a filter-sized patch of the input and the filter is a dot product. A dot product is the element-wise multiplication between the filter-sized patch of the input and filter, which is then summed, always resulting in a single value.
